    Operation of a Car Monitored by an Android Application Over WiFi
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Using Wi-Fi technology, I designed a remote-controlled car that can be operated using an android application. A camera is integrated with the microcontroller to receive real-time video transmission back to the Android hand-held device. An ultrasonic sensor is integrated with the setup which measures the distance between the car and any obstacle in its path and sends the observations to the user.
